<!--
  This view template is responsible for displaying the details of a specific movie.
  It utilizes embedded Ruby (ERB) to dynamically generate the HTML content based on
  the data retrieved from the MoviesController. The information shown includes the movie's
  image, title, release year, rating, reviews, description, director, duration, and
  total gross revenue. The layout is designed to present movie details in a user-friendly 
  manner, enhancing the overall user experience.

  The template assumes that a @movie instance variable is set in the corresponding
  controller action, containing an instance of the Movie model with all necessary attributes
  and associations.

  The overall structure is divided into two main sections: the movie details and,
  conditionally, an admin section that appears only for users with admin privileges.
-->

<section class="movie-details">
  <!-- 
    This section element serves as a container for the movie details, 
    applying a class "movie-details" for styling purposes. It enhances 
    semantic structure and makes it clear that this section contains 
    relevant information about a specific movie.
  -->

      of the film to engage users and enhance their viewing experience.
    -->

    <!-- 
      This line renders the movie's image using the 'image_tag' helper.
      - @movie.image_file_name retrieves the filename of the movie's image 
        stored in the database.
      - The image is displayed in its original size, and appropriate styles 
        can be applied via CSS to maintain layout consistency.
    -->
  </div>

  <div class="details">
    <!--

        - The use of "&bull;" (bullet) visually separates the year from the rating, 
          improving readability.
