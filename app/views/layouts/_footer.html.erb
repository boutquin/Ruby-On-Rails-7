  This partial renders the footer of the page.
  It is located at 'app/views/layouts/_footer.html.erb'.
  The footer typically appears at the bottom of every page in the application.
  It contains information such as copyright notices,
  links to the developer or organization, and other pertinent information.
  By using a partial, we ensure consistency across all pages and simplify maintenance.

      Display the copyright notice.
      - '&copy;' is an HTML entity representing the Â© symbol.
      - 'Time.now.year' retrieves the current year dynamically.
      - This ensures the footer always shows the current year without manual updates.
    -->
    &copy; <%= Time.now.year %>

    <!--
      Link to the developer's GitHub repository.
      - 'link_to' creates a hyperlink with the text 'Pierre G. Boutquin'.
      - The second argument is the URL to the GitHub repository.
      - This provides users with a way to learn more about the developer or access the source code.
