<!--
  This partial renders the header of the page.
  It is located at 'app/views/layouts/_header.html.erb'.
  The header typically appears at the top of every page in the application and includes the navigation bar.
  It contains the logo linked to the home page and the main navigation links.
  By using a partial, we ensure consistency across all pages and simplify maintenance.
-->

<header>
  <nav>
    <!--
      Display the logo at the top of the page with a link to the home page.
      - 'image_tag("logo.png")' generates an HTML <img> tag for the 'logo.png' image.
      - 'link_to' wraps the image tag in a hyperlink that points to the root path of the application.
      - 'root_path' returns the URL for the root route, which is typically the home page (e.g., '/').
      - This allows users to click on the logo to return to the home page from any page in the application.
      - The logo image should be placed in the 'app/assets/images/' directory.
    -->
    <%= link_to image_tag("logo.png"), root_path %>

    <!--
      Display the navigation links at the top of the page.
      - The '<ul>' element creates an unordered list for the navigation items.
      - Each navigation link is an '<li>' item within the list.
      - This structure allows for easy styling of the navigation menu using CSS.
    -->
    <ul>
      <li>
        <!--
          Link to the 'All Movies' page.
          - 'link_to("All Movies", movies_path)' creates a hyperlink with the text 'All Movies'.
          - 'movies_path' generates the URL for the movies index action (e.g., '/movies').
          - This link allows users to navigate to the page that lists all movies.
        -->
        <%= link_to("All Movies", movies_path) %>
      </li>
      <!--
        Additional navigation items can be added here.
        - For example, links to 'About Us', 'Contact', 'Sign In', etc.
        - Each link should be wrapped in an '<li>' element for proper formatting.
      -->
    </ul>
  </nav>
