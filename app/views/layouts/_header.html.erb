<!--
  This partial view template renders the header of the application, providing
  navigation links for users to access different parts of the site. It includes
  branding elements, navigation items, and user account options based on the
  authentication state of the user.

  The header is structured using semantic HTML elements, enhancing both
  accessibility and SEO. The navigation is split into two sections: one for 
  general site links (left) and one for user-specific actions (right).
-->

<header>
  <!-- 
    The <header> element serves as a container for introductory content or 
    navigational links. It helps define the top section of the webpage, providing
    a clear starting point for users as they interact with the application.
  -->

  <nav>
  <!-- 
    The <nav> element defines a set of navigation links. This indicates to search
    engines and assistive technologies that the links contained within are 
    related to navigation. The <nav> element enhances the structure of the 
    document, improving both usability and accessibility.
  -->

    <%= image_tag("logo.png") %>
    <!-- 
      This line renders an image for the application logo.
      - The 'image_tag' helper generates the appropriate <img> HTML element.
      - The logo serves as a branding element for the application and is usually
        linked to the home page.
      - The image is pulled from the assets pipeline, so it should be located 
        in the app/assets/images directory. If the logo is missing, Rails will 
        raise an error indicating that the file could not be found.
    -->

    <ul class="left">
    <!-- 
      This unordered list represents the left section of the navigation menu.
      - The "left" class may be used for styling purposes, allowing CSS to 
        format this list separately from the right list.
      - It can contain links that are generally accessible to all users.
    -->
      <li>
        <%= link_to "All Movies", movies_path %>
        <!-- 
          This list item contains a link to the "All Movies" page.
          - The 'link_to' helper creates a hyperlink to the movies_path, which
            points to the index action of the MoviesController.
          - The text "All Movies" is displayed as the clickable text for the link.
          - This link is essential for users to navigate to the main content area of
            the application.
        -->
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="right">
    <!-- 
      This unordered list represents the right section of the navigation menu.
      - The "right" class is used for styling and may help to position this
        menu differently in the layout.
      - It contains links related to user account management and actions.
    -->
      <% if current_user %>
      <!-- 
        This conditional checks if a user is currently signed in (authenticated).
        - The 'current_user' method typically returns the user object if a user 
          is logged in, or nil if not.
        - This check allows for different navigation options based on the user's
          authentication status.
      -->
        <li>
          <%= link_to current_user.name, current_user %>
          <!-- 
            This list item displays the name of the currently signed-in user.
            - The 'link_to' helper generates a link using the user's name, which 
              links to the user's profile page.
            - By using 'current_user', the link dynamically updates to reflect the
              logged-in user's name, enhancing personalization of the UI.
          -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <%= link_to "Account Settings", edit_user_path(current_user) %>
          <!-- 
            This list item contains a link to the user's account settings page.
            - The text "Account Settings" is displayed as the link.
            - The 'edit_user_path(current_user)' generates the URL for the edit 
              action of the current user's account.
            - Clicking this link directs the user to a form where they can modify
              their account details.
          -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <%= link_to "Sign Out", signout_path,
                data: { turbo_method: :delete },
                class: "button" %>
          <!-- 
            This list item creates a link for the user to sign out.
            - The 'link_to' helper generates a link labeled "Sign Out" that directs 
              to the signout_path, which maps to the SessionsController's destroy action.
            - The data attribute 'turbo_method: :delete' indicates that this link
              will perform a DELETE request when clicked, allowing for RESTful
              session termination.
            - The "button" class can be styled to give the link the appearance of a
              button, enhancing the user interface.
          -->
        </li>
      <% else %>
      <!-- 
        This block is executed if there is no currently signed-in user.
        - It provides navigation options for users who are not logged in, allowing
          them to sign in or register for a new account.
      -->
        <li>
          <%= link_to "Sign In", signin_path, class: "button" %>
          <!-- 
            This list item creates a link for users to sign in to their accounts.
            - The link is labeled "Sign In" and points to the signin_path,
              which directs users to the SessionsController's new action (the sign-in form).
            - The "button" class can be styled to enhance the appearance of the link.
          -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <%= link_to "Sign Up", signup_path, class: "button" %>
          <!-- 
            This list item creates a link for users to create a new account.
            - The link is labeled "Sign Up" and points to the signup_path,
              which directs users to the UsersController's new action (the registration form).
            - This option encourages new users to join the application and is crucial 
              for user onboarding.
            - The "button" class can also be styled to make this link visually appealing.
          -->
