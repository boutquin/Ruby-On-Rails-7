# User Sign Up View
# ============================================================================
# This view template provides a sign-up form for new users to create an account
# within the application. It uses embedded Ruby (ERB) to dynamically generate 
# HTML content based on the data passed from the UsersController.
#
# The template assumes that the @user instance variable is a new instance of the 
# User model, populated in the new action of the UsersController. The form 
# allows users to enter their details, including name, email, password, and 
# password confirmation. Upon submission, the form data will be processed to 
# create a new user account.

<h1>Sign Up</h1>
<!-- This H1 heading clearly indicates the purpose of the page as the sign-up
     section for new users. It helps orient users as to what action they 
     are about to perform. -->

<%= render "form", user: @user %>
<!-- This line renders a partial template called "form" that contains the 
     actual form fields for user registration. The user variable is passed 
     to the form partial, which allows it to be either a new user or an 
     existing user being edited.
     The "form" partial is expected to handle the creation of the form 
     elements, including fields for the user's name, email, password, 
     and password confirmation.
     The form utilizes Rails' form helpers, which handle setting up the 
     necessary input fields based on the user model's attributes, 
     making it easier to manage user data validation and submission. 
     This encapsulation allows for better code organization and 
     reusability across the application. -->
