<!--
  This view template displays a list of users in the application.
  It utilizes embedded Ruby (ERB) to dynamically generate HTML content
  based on the data passed from the UsersController.

  The template assumes that the @users instance variable is an array
  of User objects, populated in the index action of the UsersController.
-->

<h1><%= pluralize(@users.size, "User") %></h1>
<!--
  The <h1> tag displays the title of the page, indicating the number
  of users present. The `pluralize` helper method is used here to
  ensure proper pluralization based on the number of users.

  Example Output:
  - If there are 0 users: "0 Users"
  - If there is 1 user: "1 User"
  - If there are 2 users: "2 Users"
  - The pluralization ensures the text is grammatically correct,
  improving the user experience.
-->

<ul class="users">
  <!--
    The <ul> element creates an unordered list to contain each user.
    The class "users" can be styled with CSS to differentiate this
    section visually or for layout purposes.
  -->

  <% @users.each do |user| %>
  <!--
    The `each` method iterates over the @users array. For each user
    object in the array, a block of code is executed.

    The block variable `user` represents the current User object
    being iterated over. This allows us to access user attributes
    such as `name` and `created_at` within the block.
  -->

    <li>
    <!--
      Each user is wrapped in an <li> element, which represents
      a single item in the list. This structure helps with semantic
      HTML and improves accessibility for screen readers.
    -->

      <%= link_to user.name, user %>
      <!--
        The `link_to` helper method creates a hyperlink for the user.
        It takes two arguments:
        - `user.name`: This is the text displayed for the link,
          which is the user's name.
        - `user`: This is the path that the link directs to,
          typically the `show` action for the User, generated based
          on Rails' routing conventions.

        Example Output:
        If the user's name is "John Doe" and their profile URL is 
        `/users/1`, the output will be:
        <a href="/users/1">John Doe</a>
      -->

      created
      <!--
        The static text "created" is included to provide context
        to the user about what follows. This indicates that the
        next information relates to when the user account was created.
      -->

      <%= time_ago_in_words(user.created_at) %> ago
      <!--
        The `time_ago_in_words` helper method is used to format
        the `created_at` timestamp of the user into a human-readable
        format, indicating how long ago the user was created.
        
        Example Output:
        If a user was created 5 minutes ago, this would output:
        "5 minutes ago".

        This method enhances user experience by providing a more
        intuitive understanding of time rather than displaying raw
        timestamps.
      -->
    </li>
    <!--
      Closing tag for the <li> element. Each user is presented as
      a list item, helping to structure the user list clearly.
    -->
  <% end %>
  <!--
    Closing tag for the each loop. After this point, all users
    in the @users array have been processed and displayed.
  -->
</ul>
<!--
  Closing tag for the <ul> element. This concludes the list of users
  displayed on the page.
-->
