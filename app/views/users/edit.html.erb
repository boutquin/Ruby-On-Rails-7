# User Edit View
# ============================================================================
# This view template provides an interface for existing users to edit their 
# account details within the application. It uses embedded Ruby (ERB) to 
# dynamically generate HTML content based on the data passed from the 
# UsersController.
#
# The template assumes that the @user instance variable is an instance of the 
# User model that has been populated in the edit action of the UsersController.
# This user object contains the current values of the user's attributes,
# allowing the form to be pre-filled with the existing data.
# ============================================================================

<h1>Edit Account</h1>
<!-- This H1 heading serves as the primary title for the page, clearly indicating 
     to the user that they are in the account editing section. It provides 
     immediate context about the purpose of the form they are about to 
     interact with, helping to orient the user within the application. -->

<%= render "form", user: @user %>
<!-- This line renders a partial template called "form" that contains the 
     necessary input fields for the user to edit their account information.
     The user variable is passed to the form partial, which allows it to
     represent the specific user being edited.
     
     The "form" partial is expected to handle the creation of the form elements,
     including fields for the user's name, email, password, and password 
     confirmation. By using the existing user data in the @user instance variable,
     the form fields will be pre-filled with the current values, providing 
     a user-friendly experience.
     
     Utilizing a partial for the form promotes code reuse and keeps the code 
     organized. It allows the same form structure to be used for both user 
     registration (in the new view) and account editing (in this edit view),
     maintaining consistency across the application while minimizing 
     duplication of code. The partial can also manage validation errors and 
     form submission handling, ensuring a smooth user experience. -->
